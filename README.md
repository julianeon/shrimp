# Title

Image expander. An image expands from the center of the page, geting bigger and bigger, infinitely.

# Purpose

This is an example of using setCounter in combination with inline styling with React. Very easy to understand, see the code.

Truthfully, I thought it would be a fun project that could easily piggyback off the code I used for the circles project, so I wrote it up in a few minutes and here we are.
